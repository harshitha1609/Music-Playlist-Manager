# Music-Playlist-Manager
The Music Playlist Manager is a project developed in C that demonstrates the use of data structures such as linked lists,
arrays, and queues to efficiently manage a music playlist. This application allows users to add, delete, search, and display songs
within the playlist, as well as sort the playlist by various criteria like title, artist, or duration. The program also includes features
for saving and loading playlists, making it a practical tool for understanding data structure implementation in C. The project was created
as part of a Data Structures course, showcasing the application of core concepts in a real-world scenario. The code is organized for easy compilation
and execution, with clear instructions for usage, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced programmers.
